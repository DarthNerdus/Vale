## Vale Color Scheme

This is a modified version of C4MS/Vale. It uses Menlo and adds bold and italics copied from the popular Monokai theme.

# Hello there!,

I made this color scheme with the intention to satisfy my own eyes, but why keep it to myself? 
I'm sure someone around the globe would like it as well .
